# Prism-Samples
These applications are provided for the purposes of demonstrating the capabilities of the Prism Framework as well as to be used as a learning tool for consumers of the framework.  They are free to be used by anyone, be they a developer, architect, manager, enthusiast, student, teacher, code monkey, regular monkey, hyper-intelligent plant, otherworldly being, etc.

Projects that have their names appended with the word 'Source' are set up to reference the framework source projects.  These projects assume a specific directory structure, and that structure is identical to the structure of the repositories.  The easiest way to ensure that this structure is followed is to clone each of the repositories to the same directory.  If you choose to not follow this structure, then you will have to edit the reference paths yourself.
